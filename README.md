The Beer Cellar is an application built using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, Node.js) to manage the inventory of craft beers in your cellar. Using The Beer Cellar application, you can:
<ul><li>View all craft beers in your cellar (ordered by release date)</li>
<li>Add new craft beers to your cellar</li>
<li>Modify craft beers in your cellar</li>
<li>Remove craft beers from your cellar<li>
<li>View comments for a craft beer
<li>Add comments about a craft beer in your cellar</li></ul>


The application was built using AngularJS v1.3.10, Node.js v0.10.31, Express.js 4.11.1 and MongoDB 2.6.7. In addition to technologies that make up MEAN, additional libraries are enlisted to create the application:
<ul><li>Mongoose.js for adding structure to MongoDB</li>
<li>Angular ui-router for client-side routing</li>
<li>Twitter Bootstrap for some quick styling</ul></li>
